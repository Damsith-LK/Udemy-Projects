# About üë®‚Äçüíª
***This repository is about my Python learning and projects I have created***

______________________

## Things I have added here so far üíª
- ### [Flight Club and Flight Deal Finder (Day 39 and 40)](https://replit.com/@damsithbrosl/Flight-Club?v=1)
   - In this completed version, users can enter their details in a replit and the program updates the details into a google sheet

   - Summary - The program checks for flights (In the period of tomorrow to next 6 months) to specific locations in a google sheet,
                                        if the actual price of a flight is cheaper than the price in google sheet then
                                         send a email with relevent information to the emails that are in a google sheet
   - Note - The departure location of the flights is, Colombo (IATA Code - CMB) and the default value for maximum stop-overs is 1
   
- ### Workout Tracker with Google Sheets üí™ (Day 38)
   - In this program, user can input the exercises they did along with durations
     and then those data is sent to a API through POST method, the API returns some data (eg - How much calories spent).
     After that, the program asks the user the date and time they did those exercises
     Finally, the program updates a google sheet via another API with the following data:
                 1. Date
                 2. Time
                 3. Exercise (eg :- Push-up)
                 4. Duration
                 5. Calories
   - Note - Don't assume the calory count to be 100% accurate because defining the calory count may differ from person to person

- ### [Habit Tracker](https://pixe.la/v1/users/damsithbrosl/graphs/graph1.html) üßò (Day 37)
   - Via this program, I'm going to update my meditation time periods
     You can see those in https://pixe.la/v1/users/damsithbrosl/graphs/graph1.html

- ### Stock Trading Alert Program üìà (Day 36)
   - Summary - The program checks the percentage between yesterday's closing value and day before yesterday's closing value of TSLA (Tesla Inc) company.
          If the percantage is greater than 5% or if it is smaller than -5%, program gets data from news API.
          And then it sends the top 3 news pieces to the desired email via smtplib
   - Problems - The stock updates seem to be quite late. And I assume they are updated in evening (I'm in Colombo Time Zone)

- ### Rain Alert Program ‚òî (Day 35)
   - Summary - In this program, it checks if it will rain in next 12 hours via openweathermap API
          and if it predicts that it will rain in next 12 hours an e-mail is sent saying 'Bring An Umbrella'

- ### Quizzler App ‚ÅâÔ∏è (Day 34)
   - This is a upgraded version of day 17 quiz game
   - Uses a GUI instead of text inputs
   - Uses questions from random topics via Trivia API

- ### Day 33 (Learn about API and create a **ISS Overhead Notifier** and a **Kanye Quote Program**)
  - In this program, an e-mail is sent if the International Space Station near me and if it is currently dark
  - In this commit, I created two functions 'is_iss_above_me()' and 'it_is_dark_now()', so that the code is more readable and easy to understand
  - Note: I think there is a minor problem with the sunrise-sunset API used in this program


- ### Day 32 üìß (Learn e-mail sending with **Smtplib** and do monday-motivation sender and *automated-birthday-wisher*)

- ### Flash Card App üìë (Day 31)
  - This is a simple flash card app that allows the user to test their French words memory. The user can interact with the program using the buttons.
  - In this program the user can select whether they already know the current word or not by simply clicking the right button or the wrong button.
  - If the user clicks the right button, the row containing that word and it's translation will be deleted from the words_to_learn.csv.
  - So after that the program would only show the words in words_to_learn.csv and it wouldn't show the words that the user already knows.
  - If the user runs the program for the first time or the words_to_learn.csv file is deleted, the program would consider all the words are unknown.

- ### Day 30 work (in **features** branch) (Add json and search feature in password manager)
- ### Password Manager GUI üîë (Day 29)
